# Bouncing Ball Game

## Project Description
This bouncing ball simulation lets users keep track of current system process properties, which are tied with bouncing balls in the window.
The ball size is related to the log of the memory size(rss); the ball speed is related to cpu utilization(pcpu); the ball color is related to the number of open files(fileDescriptorCount).  
The balls update about every 10 seconds, with balls being added or removed as needed.
